      <h1>About Flavors of Lahore</h1>
      <h2>Our Journey from a Small Kitchen to a Beloved Brand</h2>
      <h3>Serving Love, Taste, and Tradition Since 2010</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Flavors of Lahore</b> started as a small family-owned restaurant in
        the heart of Lahore. What began with a single stove and a passion for
        cooking has now become a symbol of
        <i> authentic Pakistani taste</i> across the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe in preserving our <u>cultural food heritage</u> while
        adding a modern touch. Every dish we prepare reflects the warmth,
        hospitality, and flavors of Lahore’s rich traditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our chefs are trained to bring out the best in every recipe, ensuring
        each bite you take is fresh, flavorful, and unforgettable.
